But one day, he meets a mysterious girl named Pai. Pai is the sole survivor of an ancient race called ""sanzhiyan"".

107547,11044,Catacomb Abyss 3D,"The Catacomb series, which includes Curse of the Catacombs and Terror of the Catacombs, is a set of first-person shooters that are notable for being developed from the original Catacomb which was designed by John Cormack, of Doom, Commander Keen and Wolfenstein fame. This is the fourth game in the series and plays out in similar fashion to the prequels and sequels but which remains an enjoyable enough entry. The game is a sort of cross between Gauntlet and Doom, with a fantasy style that sees the player taking the role of a magician who makes use of fireballs and spells rather than hi-tech weaponry. You are once again on the trail of the evil Nemesis and must free the townspeople from his reign of terror, which basically means venturing into a series of dungeons and blasting his minions into dust. Changes to the formula this time around include new environments which see you exploring areas beyond the previous games dungeons, including gardens, volcanoes and mines, and new enemies with some distinctive behaviour. The addition of a radar is also a neat touch and which requires the player to discover specific gems in order to reveal different kinds of monsters. Catacomb Abyss is a solid entry into the series, offering a few changes to the basic gameplay but nothing revolutionary. The combat remains fast, furious and uncomplicated and there are plenty of thrilling moments to be experienced. The graphics are decent enough in that old-school fashion, with big, bold sprites and varied environments which present plenty of opportunities for exploration. If you're looking for an enjoyable shooter then this certainly delivers, but its lack of depth and variety soon become obvious and its appeal wanes quickly.",1992-03-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In most phases there is also a mini-bosses, this is very easy to defeat.

135290,12021,Curse of Enchantia,"In a parallel universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the cruel rule of a powerful coven of wicked witches. Their vain and terrible queen, who managed to surpass the rest in depravity, seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers from all the other witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in the 1990s, a young English teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.

After breaking out from his prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming to a halt in a cavern maze. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.",1992-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.9963,7

The player takes the role of one of many billions of lifeforms created by Gaia, the nurturing and benevolent daughter of Sol, the Sun. Among the creatures known as life, there is a competition to evolve, and the best lifeform will eventually be granted the privilege of entering the Garden of Eden and becoming the husband and partner of Gaia. As the game progresses, it soon becomes apparent some mysterious external force is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner. Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously powerful beings that dominate all other lifeforms, overconsume resources and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue as intended.

In the final Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns a mysterious entity is controlling the world's other lifeforms and sending them against the player. This entity turns out to be Bolbox, a lifeform that has evolved into a freakish and evil advanced being by consuming the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, but in reality is a gigantic single-celled organism. In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced civilization on Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and observe until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.",1992-12-21 00:00:00.000,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,70.1231,17

A podmate challenges Ecco to a game to see how high he can jump into the air. When he is in the air, a giant waterspout forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay, Ecco swims around meeting other marine life including other dolphins who tell them they have felt the storm and the entire ocean is in chaos. An orca Ecco encounters tells him to travel to the Arctic to meet the ""Big Blue,"" an old blue whale revered by marine life for its age and wisdom, who might be able to help him on his journey. Arriving in the Arctic after a long travel through the ocean, Ecco finds the Big Blue who informs the dolphin the storms occur every 500 years. Though the Big Blue doesn't know what causes the storms, he suggests Ecco find the Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. The Asterite greets Ecco telling him though it has the power to aid him, the Asterite cannot because orbs from its body have been lost. The Asterite tells him to go to the sunken ruins of the city of Atlantis, and use the time machine left behind by the Atlanteans.

Ecco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers an ancient library filled with Glyphs, giant crystals stored with information. From the library Ecco learns the origins of the storms, an alien race known as the Vortex lost the ability to produce food on their planet, so every 500 years when the planets align, they use their technology to harvest the waters of Earth. The Atlanteans fought a long war with the Vortex that ended when a beam struck Atlantis from space sending the city into the depths of the ocean. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate with a Pteranodon. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Ecco is sent flying through outer space to a giant tube-like machine. Making his way through the construct Ecco arrives on the planet Vortex engaging the aliens in combat. He makes his way to the Vortex Queen and engages her in a fight. When the Queen is defeated she spits out Ecco's pod she ate and they make their quick escape back to Earth.",1992-12-23 00:00:00.000,14,NULL,30.0000,1,72.7090,56

In a time two thousand and hundreds of years ago, the world was ruled by the clan of the Makōtei, spreading their misery around the nations of world through their reign of evil. But in one generation, in order to oppose the tyranny of their next heir, a group of high priests raised his younger brother to be the Tentei, granting him the power to fight the Makōtei clan. From that point, an age of conflict began between the Makōtei and Tentei, setting rightfulness against heresy.

A wedding ceremony was taking place in a church. As the young couple were vowing their love for each other, the Imperial Army of the Makōtei suddenly attacked, taking the bride with them. The young man has now began a journey to rescue his fiancee.

The Makōtei's army's attacks were extremely severe. The martial arts sworn to protect the Tentei, namely the ones from the Hokuto, Nanto, and Gento schools, attacked with nothing but raging fire. In various places around the world, the violent conflicts unfoled between the Makōtei's army and the masters of these arts such as Rei of Nanto Suichō Ken, Falco of Gento Kō Ken, Toki, and Fudoh. The world was in turmoil, as it become governed by pain and misery. Time has been waiting for the revival of the Tenteiken, the only martial art capable of defeating the Makōtei. Only Kenshiro, the greatest master of Hokuto Shinken, holds the key.

In a turbulent time filled with sorrow, a group of passionate men bear the scars of their emotions, as they now challenge the Makōtei to a final battle.",1992-07-10 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Protected by the power of the seven sacred stones and guided by seven guides, the country was said to have been promised eternal peace and prosperity. However, when an evil shadow fell on one of the stones, Rumbleville was destroyed in an instant. The seven imams with the sacred stone led their people on a journey in search of a new land.

One night, many years later, in Astholm, a town blessed with a sapphire stone, Phyllis, a girl from a family that has inherited the stone, is performing the annual Sapphire Festival, the first ceremony after becoming a new priest. The festival is in full swing, the ceremony goes off without a hitch, and Phyllis meets up with the town's garrison leader, a boy, at the edge of the village. Suddenly, however, a monster appears and snatches Phyllis away. All that remains is the sapphire Phyllis was wearing. The next day, with the sapphire in hand, the boy and his fellow garrison members set out on a journey to save Phyllis.",1992-12-15 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

One day a messenger arrives from a small neighboring kingdom, warning the princes that the evil King Delarin has invaded the Mille-Feuille Kingdom and captured the beautiful princess Tiramisu. In yet another boastful attempt to best the Sablé Prince, Richard grabs a boat and rushes towards the kingdom. The Sablé Prince is left trying to catch up.

101947,16035,Kid Chameleon,"The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the ""main path"" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called ""Elsewhere"". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes.

As Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.",1992-05-28 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,84.8930,27

68060,38779,Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete,"Grab the nearest sharp object and pull on that rusty suit of chain mail, here comes an irate barbarian carrying a sword with your name on it! Welcome to The Labyrinths of Crete, where the blades are sharp and the average life span of a combatant is less than ten minutes. 
 
In Minotaur, two or more players on different computers are thrown into a huge, randomly generated maze and through the use of various magical and mundane items attempt to find and kill each other. There are over eighty different objects, spells and armaments which any player can pick up and use against his opponents. Loose alliances form and are quickly broken— in the end, only one of the warriors who entered the maze will leave alive! 
 
The best way to understand Minotaur is to read this documentation carefully and then play the game several times with the quick-reference nearby. You should attempt to learn the effects of all of the objects and spells so that you can use them quickly and to your advantage. 
 
Speed is critical in Minotaur: recognizing what magic your opponent is using and swiftly moving to counter it is paramount. Keep moving at all times, as he who hesitates is certainly lost. Be ready for your opponents to materialize around you when it is least expected, and hope they are not as watchful. Good luck, and good hunting!",1992-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

109124,136790,Multi-Users in Middle-earth,"MUME has been around a number of years and has a lot of interesting features. It has thousands of rooms, covering the Blue Mountains in the west, the Grey Havens, Bree, the Shire, Fornost in the north, Tharbad in the south, Rivendell, the Misty Mountains, the Carrock and Lórien to the east. There are other places such as the dreaded Mines of Moria, the Orc Caves, the dark and ancient Old Forest, the forest of Mirkwood, the mysterious forest Fangorn and the Troll Warrens. 
 
You can meet a lot of interesting people, such as the elves Cirdan, Elrond, Arwen, Celeborn or Galadriel, the leader of the Istari-Council Saruman, the mean trolls Bill, Bert and Tom or you can just buy a beer in Barliman's famous Inn. The mysterious Tom Bombadil sings his songs in the Old Forest, in which Old Man Willow has taken its roots long ago. And deep down in the earth, in the deepest mines of Moria, you may find a horror that was forgotten a long time ago. You will also meet many others from whom you heard the one or other tale or who are new to you. 
 
You also can solve many quests. You can open ancient dwarven tombs or help a poor shopkeeper find something he lost, defeat fearsome enemies and search for ancient lore. Explore long forgotten towers and hidden places or just lean back with a good beer and listen to the one or other story, told by one of the storytellers. 
 
Players can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics. The races are separated into three striving factions. Dwarves, Elves, Half-Elves, Hobbits and Men — among them are the shapeshifting Beornings — are eternally at war with the Orcs, Trolls and Black Númenóreans. Moreover, the orkish tribe of the Zaugurz is trying to expand its territory at the expense of the Tarkhnarb Orcs of Goblin Gate. Most of this conflict takes place to the east and south of the town of Bree, but rare raids or solitary agents of the Red Eye have made it to as far west as the Dwarven homes in the Blue Mountains.",1992-12-31 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

108306,12761,Pools of Darkness,"The party's objective is to defeat Bane's lieutenants Thorne (an ancient red dragon), Kalistes (a Tanar'ri Marilith), and Tanetal (a Tanar'ri Glabrezu) and acquire the items they possess. The ultimate goal is to reach Bane's Land and face off against Bane's last and greatest lieutenant, Gothmenes (a Tanar'ri Balor). 
 
All of the lieutenants are found in other dimensions, which can be reached using portals known as Pools of Darkness. Traveling through the pools can cause many types of items the characters are holding to be permanently destroyed and lost. The party may opt to leave these items in a vault to save them. Naturally, any items from the dimensions will suffer this same fate when traveling back to the realms. Some items that will survive include the Vorpal Long Sword, magic rings, and composite bows. 
 
There are also many side quests the party can do along the way, which can help the party in gaining experience and items, especially early on. There are a lot of invisible areas on the overworld the party can enter, which can be found if the player looks around the open fields for any such places. This is true of all the overworlds. 
 
The mandatory quests involve: 
 
  Clearing the Steading near Dragonhorn's Gap, which opens the way to the Dragon's Aerie. 
  Clearing the Dragon's Aerie, which opens the way to Thorne's Cave via a Pool of Darkness. 
  Clearing Thorne's Cave, which will give the party the Horn of Doom. 
  Clearing the drow caves and Kalistes' Temple under Zhentil Keep, which opens the way to Kalistes' Land via a Pool of Darkness. 
  Clearing Kalistes' Parlor, which will give the party the Crystal Ring. 
  Clearing the red tower of Marcus, which opens the way to Moander's body via a Pool of Darkness. 
  Clearing the heart of Moander where Tanetal resides, which will give the party the Talisman of Bane. 
  Clearing Arcam's Cave under Mulmaster, which opens the way to Bane's Land via a Pool of Darkness. 
  Finally, clearing Bane's Land and defeating Gothmenes (a Tanar'ri Balor), who battles Elminster. 
 
There are also side quests in several places, and famous people in the realm too. For example, Elminster was always there to maintain the dimensional portal for the party should they arrive at any Pool of Darkness. The lost princess Alusair Nacacia will ask the party to help her to fight Rakshasas in Myth Drannor. Lastly, after finishing the final quest, the party had the option to either end their journey or go through one more dungeon of enemies and traps, known as ""Dave's Challenge"".",1992-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

97880,42420,Psycho Dream,"In the early 1980s, rumors begin to circulate about a new entertainment medium called “D Movie”, which allows people to immerse themselves in a world of virtual reality. As D Movies gain traction, a trend emerges of disaffected young people taking permanent refuge in the virtual world while abandoning their physical bodies to atrophy. To retrieve these so-called “Sinkers”, Japan's National Public Safety Commission establishes Public Security Division Four, nicknamed “Diamond Dog”, in 1984. The agents who enter the virtual world and perform these rescues are known as Debuggers.

In 1992, a seventeen-year-old girl named Yūki Sayaka sinks into “Story of the Ruined Capital”, a D Movie directed by David Visconti. Three days pass before she is discovered, and combined with her weak constitution, she is expected to die within twenty-four hours. Two Debuggers, Shijima Ryō and Tobari Maria, are dispatched to rescue her before that happens.",1992-12-11 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

32574,11627,Pushover,"The game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of ""dominoes"". The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time.

Various factors can result in failure to complete a level. As well as toppling all of the dominoes, the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen. For instance, the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed, or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged, or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit. G.I. Ant may die by falling from a large height, by falling off the bottom of the screen, or by being crushed under a falling domino. The player is then greeted with the message ""You Failed, You Died"" and has to restart the level. Also, the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another.

Each level has a time limit during which it must be completed. However, if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish. By pausing the game once the time has run out, a small hint will be displayed, giving advice on how to complete the level. As a side note, the hint for level 98 informs the player that the game's designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery (""Use a drop! There is a way to make it work with a push, but I can't find it!"").

The themed worlds, in order, are an industrial complex, an Aztec world, a space station, an electronic world, a Greek temple, a Medieval castle, a Meccano-inspired world, a dungeon and a Japanese temple. Each world has 11 levels, making a total of 99 regular levels. A packet of Colin's Quavers is retrieved after each world, with nine packets in all to be collected. Many of the early levels are tutorials demonstrating how each type of domino will act. Often there is only a single solution to each level, though some levels have multiple solutions. The final level, level 100, must be completed using dominoes with hidden markings.

A password system allows the player to continue an earlier game, without having to restart from the first level. Additionally, upon completing a level the player gains a token, which once a level has been failed, allows the player to return to the point before the domino push, rather than having to return to the initial state of the level.",1992-12-31 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,59.7922,9

The contaminated area becomes uninhabitable for a decade, when Lucifer-Alpha mutates into a non-lethal form. This tragic event later becomes known as ""the Catastrophe"".

The plot of this Trek is based around a giant ""Doomsday Machine"" that is destroying ships, planets, and other valuable stuff in federation space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to defeat the doomsday machine, but the Klingons think that it will be used against them. So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces spread out over 3 planets.

It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the weapon.",1992-02-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Peace has returned to the streets, the once-vacant neighborhoods are being repopulated, and prosperity has returned to the city. Adam has returned to the police force, while Axel and Blaze have moved out of the city and found jobs as a bodyguard and a dance instructor, respectively.

On the anniversary of their victory over the syndicate, Adam, Axel, and Blaze reunite to celebrate and talk about old times. The next day, however, Axel receives a frantic call from Adam's younger brother, Eddie ""Skate"" Hunter, who returned home from school to find their house completely wrecked. Worse, no one at the police station had seen or heard from Adam since early that morning. Axel and Blaze rush to investigate, and find a photo of Adam, in chains, laying at the feet of a man they know only too well. Mr. X and the Syndicate have returned, and, thirsty for revenge, have kidnapped Adam in the hopes of luring Axel and Blaze into a trap.

Adam's disappearance marked the beginning of a new nightmare. Criminal elements swarmed out to reclaim the streets. Gangs roamed the parks, and bomb-wielding bikers made the roads deadly to travel at night. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than ever before.

Axel and Blaze tried to contact their old friends at the force, the ones who once provided backup with heavy artillery. But everyone they knew had either been fired or transferred elsewhere. This time, the Syndicate was in complete control, and the two ex-cops were on their own.

Assisted by Adam's brother Skate, and Axel's friend Max, Axel and Blaze set out to rescue their friend and destroy Mr. X once and for all. Standing in their way is the nastiest collection of punks and brawlers ever assembled.

The next screen is the calibration routine required by all Super Scope titles. The screen displays a white target with a blue background.

After calibration, the player is asked to test the aim to verify its accuracy. It is not required to shoot the bullseye this time, but it's important that the shot mark lines up with where the player aimed and fired though.

103983,46575,The Ur-Quan Masters,"In the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, the Tobermoon, an Earthling ship, discovered an ancient Precursor subterranean installation in a cave on the surface of an uninhabited planet in the Vela star system. The Alliance hastily sent a secret scientific mission to study the relics, but a massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela; the mission commander, Captain Burton, decided to go into hiding on the planet and sent back the Tobermoon, her only starship, asking for help. Though the Ur-Quan forces didn't find the Earthlings during their sweep of the system, relief never arrived. Years later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a starship. Using the limited store of raw materials available in the planet, in ten years the Precursor factory built a (barely) functional ship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. In the first test flight, it was discovered that the ship Burton had sent for help had been severely damaged by the Ur-Quan and was orbiting unpowered in the outer solar system: the Alliance had never known of the mission's discoveries. The colonists decided to fix the recovered ship, train new crew members for both the Precursor ship and the Tobermoon and send a mission back to Earth, eager to know how the war had ended. Shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown ship; Captain Burton, commanding the Earthling ship, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command",1992-11-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

72995,14474,Treasures of the Savage Frontier,"A few weeks after the events of Gateway to the Savage Frontier, the mage Amelior Aminitas magically summons the party (by now called the ""Heroes of Ascore"") to eliminate the (apparently) last remaining troops of the Zhentarim from the dwarven city of Llorkh.

Afterwards, the party is given a seemingly simple mission – to protect ambassadors of the ""Lord's Alliance"", which holds together the different cities of the frontier. However, the ambassadors are kidnapped, the Zhentarim and its allies (the Kraken Society and the Hosttower of the Arcane) plot to break up the alliance to conquer the region, and the party is framed as traitors.

Much of the game is devoted to having the players attempt to clear their names (usually done by completing a mission in each town of the Lord's Alliance) and alert the alliance's leaders of the plot. The final mission (which does not necessarily fit in the overall plotline) involves retrieving a treasure held by a dragon.

To uncover the plot, the player has to collect two different sets of items:

Three different colors of crystals held by one of the three enemy groups (the Zhentarim, the Kraken, and the Hosttower). This can only be done by, in melee battles, carefully selecting and attacking different enemies in the right order.
""Lucky papers"" from each city in the game. Nominally good luck charms, when combined with the crystals, these papers spell out the entire enemy plot.",1992-11-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.8497,5

Once the Forge was stolen by the Bane King and Xorphitus the Wizard (the story of Bane of the Cosmic Forge) the planet’s obscure position in space could no longer be protected from discovery.

When the Miner’s vessel returned to its own home world, news of the discovery began to spread. It was rumored to be the Planet of Phoonzang, ""Lost Guardia"" by legend, and the secret resting place of the famed ""Astral Dominae,"" Phoonzang’s only known record of his final and greatest discovery.

The legend of the Astral Dominae dates back to a prior millennium. It tells of a great artist and scientific genius, Phoonzang, and his discovery of some deep secret, rumored to regard the power of the universe and of life itself. Phoonzang decided this secret was too powerful for anyone else to know, for if it could create a universe, it could also destroy one. So, he was faced with a choice: either destroy his discovery, his life’s work, or hide it in such a way that it would not fall into unscrupulous hands. He opted for the latter, knowing that a day might come when the secret could be safely revealed and the universe could ascend towards a new destiny.

The legend continues that he created a stellar globe, called the Astral Dominae, and encrypted his secret therein. Using the power of his secret, he created a new world, Guardia, designed to safeguard his work. He himself had become a god, for his was the power of life itself, and as he created the planet, he also created creatures to live there and to protect his secret. Entombing the Astral Dominae somewhere on this world, he made a map, consisting of many parts and then spread the parts throughout the lands of his world. Convinced that his secret was secure, Phoonzang disappeared forever.

With the discovery of the lost planet, Lost Guardia, news traveled fast that the legendary tomb of the Phoonzang’s last work, the Astral Dominae, was a reality. But while there are many who might covet the great secret, only a few have the power and resources to undertake its recovery.

One of these is an enigmatic traveler of the stars, known only as the ""Dark Savant."" Navigating all frontiers of space in his legendary black ship, not much is known of the Dark Savant except that he is considered by most worlds to be one of the most powerful entities alive, pledging alliance to no one but himself.

At the forefront of all known Galactic worlds, two rival species dominate the space trade. First, the militaristic Umpani - a lawful race of stout pachyderms who, while considered to have the greatest assemblage of military war power in the Galaxy, are known to be fair and reliable traders. Second, there is the feared and unscrupulous T’Rang - a repulsive spider-like race who will do anything if the buyer is willing to pay the price. While the T’Rang can never be fully trusted, they still manage to control the greatest trading network in the galaxy, surpassing even that of the Umpani. The T’Rang will stop at nothing to procure what they seek, and have always fulfilled their contracts, no matter how dirty the deed.

Naturally then, the Umpani and the T’Rang are strict competitors and strongly detest each other. It is suspected by some, however, that certain alliances exist between the two that prevent any third parties from entering the space trade picture, thereby strengthening the suspected cartel which, in turn, keeps the prices of their wares profitably on the high side.

There is a rumor that the T’Rang are actually in the service of the Dark Savant, who has held a long standing contract with them to find Phoonzang’s missing world. Naturally then, if the T’Rang are involved, the Umpani won’t be far behind. For it needn’t be said the affair would bode them no good fortune should the T’Rang obtain the Astral Dominae … no good at all.

There is one other, Vi Domina, a young girl with a reputation of being a rather fierce and deadly warrior, and who is also rumored to be a far distant descendant of Phoonzang, himself. Her lineage was traced by the T’Rang to repay a favor to the Dark Savant, and she was taken into his custody shortly thereafter. It is unknown whether her connection to the Dark Savant is willing or coerced, but it appears the Dark Savant believes she may hold some yet unsuspected key to unlocking the secret of the Astral Dominae.

The lands are also populated with a variety of native sons, and although they appear to be simple and primitive, there are indications that a great technical civilization may have evolved on Lost Guardia in the ages since the planet was created by Phoonzang. It is not known what role, if any, they may play in uncovering the Astral Dominae, or what secrets they may hold for those who venture in from outside worlds. And, with the startling appearance of the travelers from the stars, some have begun to suspect that their own legends may be unfolding, and the prophesied end of their world is at hand.

These are the players then, that inhabit the world of Lost Guardia, and play a role in the quest for the Astral Dominae. Thus it is that our party of brave adventurers shall set foot on Lost Guardia, and themselves seek out the truth of the Astral Dominae.",1992-12-31 00:00:00.000,1,1,NULL,NULL,80.0000,2
